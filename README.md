===============

This repo holds all the exercises I've worked through from the book "Learning Python the Hardway" 
and MIT 600 Intro to computer science

On May 4th, 2013 I started working through "Learning Python the Hardway" as well as MIT's 600
Open Course Ware. These are the exercises I've written and got working. They were written either in 
IDLE or using vi. 

Here are links to the source material:
