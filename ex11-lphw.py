##here's the same thing using raw_input only, instead of raw_input and print
##age=raw_input("How old are you in years?")
##height=raw_input("How tall are you in inches?")
##weight=raw_input("How much do you weigh in pounds?")
##print "So, you're %r years old, %r inches tall and %r pounds heavy." %(age,height,weight)
